 Problem Statement:-
 StellarMart is a mid-sized retail chain specializing in Electronics, Clothing, Home Appliances, Books, and Groceries.
 With increasing competition and shifting customer preferences, StellarMart has been facing challenges in sustaining growth.
 While some product categories generate strong revenue, others show signs of stagnation or decline.
 Despite having rich datasets on sales, customers, and products, the information is scattered and underutilized. StellarMart needs clear,
 data-driven insights to optimize category performance, understand seasonal demand patterns, and improve regional strategies.


 Business Problems:-
 Sales Decline in Certain Categories – Management is unsure which categories are thriving and which need strategic intervention.
 Seasonal Trends – There is a suspicion that demand varies significantly by season/month, but no structured analysis exists.
 Regional Performance – Different regions contribute unequally to revenue, and the company needs visibility on where to invest and where to improve.


 Project Objectives:-
 
 As a data analytics consultant, your role is to analyze StellarMart’s two years of raw data and provide actionable insights. Key objectives include:
 Sales Trend Analysis:-
       Identify monthly and seasonal fluctuations.
       Highlight growth/decline patterns over time.
 Category Performance:-
       Compare category-wise sales.
       Detect underperforming and high-performing products/categories.
 Regional Analysis:-
       Evaluate revenue contribution by region.
       Pinpoint high-growth vs underperforming markets.
 Visualization & Reporting:-
       Develop dashboards (Power BI / Tableau / Python visualization libraries).
       Provide interactive insights into sales, customer segments, and regions.


 Analysis Approach:-
 
        Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
                 Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent product/category labels.
                 Standardize regional and product hierarchy data.
                 
        Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
                 Trend analysis of sales over months/years.
                 Category-wise contribution comparison.
                 Regional breakdown of revenue share.
                 
        Feature Engineering:
                 Derive metrics such as average order value (AOV), repeat purchase rates, and seasonal indices.

        Visualization & Insights:
                 Create interactive dashboards to present
                 Sales trends (monthly, quarterly, seasonal).
                 Category-wise performance with drilldowns to products.
                 Regional revenue share with growth/decline heatmaps.


Expected Outputs:
                Sales Trends Dashboard → Clear monthly/seasonal sales fluctuations.
                Category Insights → Identification of best & worst-performing categories/products.
                Regional Performance Report → Contribution & growth per region.
